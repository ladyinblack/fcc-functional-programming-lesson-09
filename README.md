### [Use the filter method to extract data from an array](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/functional-programming/use-the-filter-method-to-extract-data-from-an-array)

## HINTS
### Hint 1
This challenge is solved in 2 steps.

`Array.prototype.filter()` is used to filter the array so it's left with elements that have imdbRating > 8.0.

`Array.prototype.map()` can be used to shape the output to the desired format.
